    I graduated from Monash University with a Bachelor's degree in Engineering and Economics. I specialize in Deep Learning and High-Performance Computing. In my previous roles at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO), Monash University, and the Japanese startup company DeepFlow, I published research papers and developed an open-source application.

    title: Can Private LLM Agents Synthesize Household Energy Consumption Data?
    description: >
      During the internship at CSIRO in 2023 summer, our team wrote a paper investigating the capability of LLM in simulating household electricity data. Our exploratory research has been accepted in an international conference, e-Energy '24: Proceedings of the 15th ACM International Conference on Future and Sustainable Energy Systems.

    title: Merit Prize for Cluster Competition at SuperComputing Asia 2024
    description: >
      The competition involved a collaborative project for developing earth-system simulation components (HPC) for use in climate and weather studies 🌦️, and the development of a multilingual language model that uses an AI cluster to provide distributed inference service.
      As part of Monash DeepNeuron, the cluster competition team won the Merit Prize at SuperComputing Asia 2024 for our work in the 6th HPC-AI APAC Competition. Our members Allister and I had the privilege of presenting our work at SCA2024 and receiving the award for the team.

    title: ROSO - Improving Robotic Policy Inference via Synthetic Observations
    description: >
      Featuring my final year project at Monash University, our research proposes the use of Generative AI to enhance zero-shot performance in robotic systems. Our approach, Robotic Policy Inference via Synthetic Observations (ROSO), employs Stable Diffusion to adapt observations of novel objects during inference, improving adaptability without extensive fine-tuning. Experiments demonstrate up to a 57% improvement in successful outcomes compared to pre-trained policies.

    title: Paraview 3D particle Visualiser
    description: >
      As a software engineer intern at DeepFlow, I had an amazing opportunity to develop Open-Source Software that enables the creation of high-quality, detailed 3D visualizations of data using ParaView and Python. This advanced 3D particle visualization software allows you to unlock the full potential of your data by creating high-quality, detailed 3D visualizations. Designed for material science, physics simulation, etc., this powerful tool offers a range of features, including data table conversion, customizable coloring and lighting, thresholding, and animation.

    title: Economics Video with 3B1B Style
    description: >
      In the context of Mathematical Economics, this video explains the introductory Consumer Theory, specifically the "Existence of a Utility Function representing Preference Relation." I intended to create this video in the style of 3Blue1Brown, incorporating sophisticated video transitions and narration.
